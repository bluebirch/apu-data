# Fix paths. (I found a workaround: set R_USER and R_LIBS_USER in Windows
# environment settings.)

# This is a workaround for R Studio Portable on Windows. For some reason, R
# Studio Portable can't find libraries needed for knitr, so I load them all in
# .Rprofile.

#require(evaluate)
#require(digest)
#require(formatR)
#require(highr)
#require(markdown)
#require(stringr)
#require(yaml)
#require(Rcpp)
#require(htmltools)
#require(caTools)
#require(bitops)
#require(knitr)
#require(jsonlite)
#require(base64enc)
#require(rprojroot)
#require(rmarkdown)

# Just write something to the console so I know processing .Rprofile is
# finished.
